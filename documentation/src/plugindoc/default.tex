The default plug-in in \systemname uses a data abstraction, called
the \systemname records to compare changes for different file formats
and data types. \systemname records transforms the header and data
of a file into an array. The records from two files are then compared
using a linear algorithm.

\section{Adaptors}

The default plug-in uses several adaptors to transform data from
different file formats into \systemname records. Currently, the
plug-in uses adaptors for the following file formats:
\begin{itemize} 
\item h5: HDF5 file format
\item fits: image file format consisting of n-dimensional arrays or tables
\item edf: time-series data
\item tif: high-quality graphics image format
\end{itemize} 

In order to use the default plug-in, users need to install the
required libraries/packages. Following is the list of all the
packages required based for the corresponding file format support.

\begin{itemize} 
\item h5: h5py
\item fits: astropy
\item edf: fabio
\item tif: fabio
\end{itemize}

\section{Change Stats}

The default plug-in captures the following data change metrics:
\begin{itemize} 
\item added:     number of data values added
\item deleted:   number of data values deleted
\item modified:  number of data values modified
\item unchanged: number of unchanged data values 
\end{itemize}

In addition, the default plug-in also calculates \% change
between two files based on the \systemname records comparison.
