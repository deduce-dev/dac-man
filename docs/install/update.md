# Updating Dac-Man

To update Dac-Man from a previous version,
follow the steps described in the [*Installing Dac-Man in an existing environment*](../#installing-dac-man-in-an-existing-environment).
These will upgrade the Dac-Man package itself, as well as its dependencies,
in the environment where Dac-Man was installed.

!!! tip
    If issues appear after updating, consider installing Dac-Man in a fresh environment instead.
    For more information about addressing common issues, refer to the [*Troubleshooting*](../../troubleshooting/) section.
