# Extending Dac-Man's Built-in Plug-ins

Dac-Man's included plug-ins are designed to be easy to extend,
serving as a starting point for users to develop custom change analysis
tailored to their particular use cases.

The Examples section contains example use cases
illustrating how to extend the [CSV plug-in](../../examples/csv-simple) and the [HDF5 plug-in](../../examples/hdf5-edf).
